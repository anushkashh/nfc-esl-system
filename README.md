NFC-Based ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) System

An Android-based application developed to read and write data on NFC-powered ESL tags, enabling real-time shelf label updates for retail environments.

Tech Stack
- Java (Android)
- NFC (NfcA, MifareUltralight, NDEF)
- ESL Devices (5.8" ESL-MC7-1)
- Android Studio

 Features
- Real-time NFC tag reading and writing
- UI to input and display updated product info
- Support for UID verification and tag validation
- Secure tag access and content modification

 Contribution
I developed the Android app interface and integrated low-level NFC protocols to communicate with ESL tags. Implemented logic for real-time data updates on shelf labels via AP and NFC.
